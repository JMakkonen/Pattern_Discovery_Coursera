# Pattern_Discovery_Coursera
Python implementation of discussed algorithms

This repo has been set up to capture and share some stuff arising from the Pattern Discovery course.
IMHO, the course should really have a coding component/exercises to it.

Anyway, see file P1026.py for some callable functions that are the basic starting items for
building a version of the apriori algorithm for finding frequent patterns in data.

Plans for the future include creating a fully functioning call library for the apriori and other 
algorithms mentioned in the course lectures.
